"A plump pig wallows in a muddy pond on a rustic farm, its pink snout poking out as it snorts contentedly. The camera captures the pig's playful splashes, sending ripples through the water under the midday sun. Wooden fences and a red barn stand in the background, framed by rolling green hills. The pig's muddy coat glistens in the sunlight, showcasing the simple pleasures of its carefree life.",assets/texts/i2v.png
